# Sketch VR

Sketch VR is designed to collect 3D sketch data from players. It has three main functions:

1. Load 3D models from given directory and display it in game on runtime. 
2. Sketch in VR.
3. Save sketch, combination of sketch and model.

It is not only a VR painting game like Quill, it can also be used for viewing 3D models (For example, VR online shopping for furnitures!). If you are interested, it can be further developed into a 3D prototyping tool after adding editing function.
